Dear, David.
I made the corona map which allows you to find the available stores in order to buy masks. 
As the Korean government manages the stock in pharmacies by sharing the data, the data was open to the public. 
This data is only written in Korean and also the map that I used as a base is written Korean.
The reason that I had to work with the Korean company map instead of Google map, 
the google map is not accurate in Korea. 
I tried to work on google map but when I searched for my place in Korea, it results in the ocean. 
That's why I had to work with another map which provides more accurate results.
After building this web API, I researched the way to translate the places names on the map and left the messages to this map company.

however, according to their reply, the map is made of images. Due to this reason, 
they initially made this map service in Korean and they have language options in their API, 
but they are not opened to Open API.

And I also use composer.json, and index.php to upload this api to heroku.
you can test this locally but i was asked to assign specific ip address.
The assigned Ip addressses with my open key are http://127.0.0.1:5501
http://127.0.0.1:5500 .
I used live server as a tool to run locally.
(dolownloaded it into visual studio code and right click on html file, and click "open with live server")
I can also assign particular ip address if you like. 
Please email me, haeinkim0@gmail.com and  i will assign the ip address.

I have attached the list written in Korean for testing purposes for you as this app would work better in Korea. 
Hope that's okay. Thanks and I am sorry for this inconvenience.

Ps.I tested on chrome and IE
