# Corona virus RESTful API

The government has implemented a five-part system to meet the surging demand for masks 
due to the recent coronavirus, making it difficult for general online/offline retailers 
to purchase masks.

Using this API, we are going to create a web page that can check the sales status of public masks 
in a specific region. With the introduction of the e-government system, 
data on various fields has been shared for several years.
However, the public mask sales information that we have started to display provides information 
in a different manner than how it has been displayed previously. 
In the past, we used the Open API through individual authentication key after requesting utilization.
 We are now receiving JSON data right away with the Rest API URL address without 
 such an individual authentication key.

Considering the seriousness of the current situation, 
I think this is to minimize the intermediate process for rapid development and give opportunities to those in need.
